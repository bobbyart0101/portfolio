<p>I did planned a trip for my german friends who visited my hometown, Taiwan. When I made a travel guide, I found there
    no website existing for Taiwan sightseeing in German. TW traveler is a website, which users can find their travel
    destination easily with filtering the geo location or another features. It can switch to map view to quick see the
    travel place.<br>
    This website is made with Nuxt/Vue as front-end and Drupal JSON Api as backend.</p>
